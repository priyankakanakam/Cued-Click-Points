# Cued-Click-Points
This project aims to provide a secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional text-based passwords by leveraging the human visual and spatial memory.
When a user logs in, a unique binary is generated for each image in the set, unlike the typical graphical password authentication process. This binary is sent to the user's email address.
The user is meant to click the incorrect point for each binary digit that is represented by 0 and the correct position for each binary digit that is represented by 1.
Since it might be quite challenging for a user to recall details precisely, some toleranceÂ is provided.

Features
User-friendly graphical password authentication.
Enhanced security through the use of cued click points.
Customizable settings for users to set their click point sequences.
Easy integration with existing authentication systems.

Language-Java
Backend-MySQL
IDE used- Eclipse
